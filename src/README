#very quick instructions for running basic script

you just need to run './getscrappy.sh <minvalue> <maxvalue> <filename>' (run it from its directory!)
where:
minvalue: the lowest number to be requested.
maxvalue: the lowest number to be requested.
filename: the new file to be created.(the scripts overwrites any file with this name)

try to generate files using the following convention:
d<minval>t<maxval>.t
ie:
  d0t10k.t
  d20kt30k.t

ie: ./getscrappy 10001 20000 d10kt20k.t
