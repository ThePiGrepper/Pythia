#very quick instructions for running basic script

you just need to run 'getscrappy.sh <minvalue> <maxvalue> <filename>'
where:
minvalue: the lowest number to be requested.
maxvalue: the lowest number to be requested.
filename: the new file to be created.(the scripts overwrites any file with this name)

try to generated files using the following convention:
d<minval>t<maxval>.t
ie:
  d0t10k.t
  d20kt30k.t
